Coupon - int discount, String merchantId
Given a list of coupons, a maxCouponsPerMerchant integer, and a maxListSize
Return a list of maxListSize with the best coupons overall, and at most maxCouponsPerMerchant per merchant
Sort, use HashMap to keep track of max per merchant 

Given two lists of coupons, create bundles, sorted by merchantId
Walk down both lists simultaneously
If one list is a lot larger, use binary search with the first list as the index to search for

Indeed
Design an ExpiringMap<K, V> class
put(K key, V value, long duration)
get(K key) - returns null if value has expired

Used HashMap with Value<V> class
- Out of memory issues, can remove expired values on put or get

ExtraHop
Monotonically increase Chart c, with maxX(), minX(), and getY(x) methods
Given a y, find the x
- Binary search
