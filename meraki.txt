Given a list of words, return the word with the highest frequency.
["foo", "bar", "bazz", "bizz", "bar"] -> "bar"

Now, return a list of words with the highest frequency, i.e. for the cases where there are multiple words whose occurences are all equal to the highest frequency.
["foo", "bar", "bazz", "bizz", "bar", "bizz"] -> ["bar", "bizz"]

Given a phrase which is a list of words and an input, find the number of occurrences of that phrase in the input.
For example, "this is my cool phrase and my cool phrase is really cool" as the input, and my phrase as ["my", "cool", "phrase"] returns 2.

Given a String that represents an IP Address, convert it into a String representing its binary form.
For example:
192.8.10.255 -> 11000000000010000000101011111111
10.0.80.0 -> 00001010000000000101000000000000

Solution: Split the string on periods, use Integer.toBinaryString(int).

Given a subnet, in CIDR form, and an IP Address, determine whether the IP Address is in that subnet.
192.8.10.255/32 192.8.10.24 -> False
192.8.10.255/0 10.0.80.0 -> True

Solution: Convert both to binary strings, match up to range characters.

Given a list of subnets, determine if any pair within the list have overlapping IP Addresses.
[192.8.10.255/32, 10.0.80.0/0, 10.0.80.0/23] -> True

Solution: Sort the subnets by IP Address, walk down the list and compare in linear time.
