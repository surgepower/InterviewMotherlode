Given a list, which can contain duplicate entries, of words, where each word is exactly 4 characters long, return four of those words which can be used to construct a magic square.

MIST
AREA
MOAN
ANTS

Reads left to right, top to bottom.

Use a trie, construct the square by row and column simultaneously.
Preprocess the list.
M1 I2 S3 T4 ... 

Given an array of numbers which indicate the height of a bar in a histogram, return the area of the largest rectangle that can fit in the histogram.

Divide and conquer - nlogn, find the minimum, multiply by range. Repeat.

There's an O(n) solution. Use a stack.
